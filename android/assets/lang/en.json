  "intro.1": "The surface of ale in your mug reflected stars through the windows of the dark tavern. You are sitting in the tavern with your friend Arthur, whom you have not seen since your college years. You are talking about the old times and past adventures. The meeting was highly anticipated, but his nervousness seems to be unusual. Each time the door squeaks behind him, he cringes and becomes tense as if waiting for something. Despite a rather simple dialogue, you understand that he needs something and that something is much more important than he wants to admit. You spend the whole evening recollecting your college years, but the growing curiosity is niggling you. After realizing that you cannot just sit still and knowing that there must be a reason behind it, you decide to ask a straightforward question, when suddenly something terrible occurs...",
  "intro.2": "A monstrous flash, followed by a deafening roar, dazzles all visitors. An invisible force picks you up and throws you into the wall, showering you with shards of glass, chips and splashes of alcohol. You open your eyes and understand that you are in the midst of the ruins. It’s a miracle that you weren’t injured, except for the ear buzzing, several bruises and scratches. But Arthur is not that well. He is lying on the floor, pinned down by the ceiling beam. You are trying to lift it, when suddenly you notice a bloody stain slowly spreading under it.",
  "intro.3": "He looks at you unseeingly but finds the strength to speak. “I didn’t know whom I could trust, Wilson. They could kill us both... It means you’re not on their side...” A pain distorted his face. He takes a short breath and continues, barely holding back the scream. “Take this... envelope. It contains everything you need to know. Alexander knows the code. He knows how to read it. Find him. Alexander Cooper. Find him. They control everything. The lives... depend on it. They are here! You have to run! Now...” He is looking over your shoulder for a second and then stills forever. You hear someone laugh and shots behind you. You look around and realize that you can’t help anyone. You take the envelope from the hands of your late friend and decide to follow his last advice. Who and why organized the explosion? Is it really about the envelope?",
  "intro.4": "Approaching the house where you’re renting an apartment, you notice that the balcony door is wide open. You go up the stairs but freeze after hearing voices upstairs. Someone is talking standing at the front door. A few more steps and a thug with a knife falls on you. You dart back forcefully and lose balance, dragging him with you. After hitting his head, the bouncer loses consciousness but his friends are already running down the stairs. You get up fast, sprint to the exit and run as far as possible until you are short of breath. What did you get yourself in? You decide to look for Alexander Cooper mentioned by Arthur before his death to find answers.",

  "place.info.0": "One of the oldest districts of Staighrem located on the outskirts of the city. Many hundreds of years ago there was a huge wall running across Bridgewall. But the flood destroyed it. Locals reinforced the remainder of this wall and now it serves as a sturdy bridge across the channel.",
  "place.info.1": "Bristol is famous for its pubs, restaurants, cabarets, theatres, and other establishments that come to life in the evening. Most of the day, from early morning to evening, Bristol seems dead. But at night real miracles happen here; there are so many people roaming the street, it is difficult to breathe. This district is the embodiment of Staighrem’s nightlife.",
  "place.info.2": "For many hundreds of years, Forgetown District has been a haven for blacksmiths, carpenters, and weavers. But eventually, they were replaced by various factories. Today the representatives of industrial era working class like steelworkers and mechanics govern it.",
  "place.info.3": "Stonehall received its name after the frame of an ancient stone building. Its four arcs looming over the main square of the district. This ancient monument was so difficult to wreck that city authorities gave up and decided to leave it untouched. Over time, many tales stuck to the story of granite frame’s origin.",
  "place.info.4": "Small Market received its name for crowded shopping area rather than for the size of the district itself. As the city limits expanded, the demand rose and attracted so many merchants, that a small platform for their activities turned into a swarming anthill of “hucksters” of all kinds. Remarkably, the noblemen never visit here.",
  "place.info.5": "Benjamin Collin was the richest aristocrat in the history of Staighrem. During his last years of life, he spent his incredibly large fortune to plant a huge garden in the part of the city that was burnt down in the fire. He later presented this garden to the citizens. Every year the huge area covered with parks, hedgerows, and green mazes attracting tourists from all over the Empire.",
  "place.info.6": "This district was named after the boatman Benelict Cumberhatch who became famous during a peasant uprising. A crazed crowd was the cause of the fire in which an orphanage burned down. Cumberhatch saved children at the expense of his life and died buried under the rubble. The orphanage was rebuilt and it now bears his name, like the district.",
  "place.info.7": "About a hundred years ago tea traditions of the south of the Empire began to seep into Staighrem. Many merchants and immigrants rushed into the city and occupied a vacant niche. It so happened that this district at the time was the most favourable with regard to the cost of both housing and trading platform rentals.",
  "place.info.8": "Contrary to the conventional view of large city harbours, the Port District is distinguished by its purity. Staighrem authorities spend huge amounts of money to maintain it clean, mindful of a terrible plague that killed off almost half of the city population eighty years ago. Since then, sanitary conditions of the Port District are strictly controlled.",
  "place.info.9": "Elite city district where the majority of nobles live. But, business development made ordinary people, who were very fortunate, now can live in the neighbourhood of nobles. For example, the owner of the shoe shops network lives next to the war hero Count Echevarria. Remarkably, the merchant’s house is two floors higher.",
  "place.info.10": "Fairwell is widely known among the local population. No society class leaves it without due attention. Police, criminals, workers, nobles — you can meet any of them in the only district of the city, where brothels are officially allowed. However, not all local residents like the proximity of the brothels, and so. The long war for the abolition of sexual services for affluent citizens is not subsiding.",
  "place.info.11": "Contrary to the Small Market, the Large Market received its name because of the spacious shopping area. Nobles prefer to walk around contemplating the diversity of goods offered. The prices are high by the standards of regular residents. This fact provides a small audience consisting only of “decent citizens”.",
  "place.info.12": "This city district is characterized by lush vegetation and fertile soil. For a thousand years local farmers have been supplying the city with vegetables and fruit. Many present-day aristocrats derived their origin from here. Once farming was the only way to climb the social ladder.",
  "woman.in.trable.text": "You are passing through the stone bridge leading across a small water canal. Suddenly you notice a nicely dressed woman. She looking at the water surface. The lady is standing with her back turned to you and quietly sobs. She occasionally drying her tear-streaked cheeks with a handkerchief. The woman doesn’t notice or doesn’t want to notice your presence.",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.1": "Walk by",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.1.action.1": "You walk past pretending that you haven’t noticed anything. Sharp pain pierces your head. The world turns upside down and the stone pavement is coming closer to you knocking the air from your lungs. The woman leans over you, steel brass knuckles with etching shining in her hand. She picks your breast pocket, but suddenly a police whistle sounds. The policeman helps you get up. The woman seems to disappear. But she managed to take something from you.",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.1.action.2": "You walk by, but a slight movement on the left attracts your attention and you turn around. The woman who had been crying only seconds ago was heading in your direction but froze as soon as you turned around. Her face now shows no sign of past grief. You still have not figured anything out when you see a police squad appear around the corner. Without hesitation, the woman disappears leaving you at loss in the middles of the bridge.",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.2": "Ask a stranger the cause of her tears",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.2.action.1": "You approach the lady and want to ask her a question but noticing two suspicious guys at some distance from you. They pretend to be talking but are actually impatiently glancing in your direction. For a moment, you stop in thought when suddenly a squad of cops coming from the backstreet. Without saying as much as a word to each other, the two guys direct off in different directions.",
  "woman.in.trable.choice.2.action.2": "You approach the crying lady and ask a question trying to look her in the eyes. Two men, who seconds ago have been standing at a distance, grab you at your hands squeezing tightly and shut your mouth. The woman rummages through your clothes and takes something out of your chest pocket. A deafening whistle interrupts the search and an expression of fear appears on the lady’s face. Sharp pain in the back of your head and the echo of someone’s feet scurrying — this is all that’s left of the three robbers. The police officer, who comes to your rescue with a whistle in his hands, tries to help you get back on your feet.",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.text": "Walking past the bar you could not resist and stopped by to have a drink and have some rest. After sitting down on a bench by the window, you first feel, and then notice a close look of small yellow eyes on you. A goblin in a quilted and shabby coat appears from the dark corner on the opposite side of the bar. He nods to the bartender, then approaches you and sits across the table offering you good products at affordable prices.",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.1": "Show interest",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.1.action.1": "Green-skinned shortie gives you a gap-toothed smile. He dives his hand deep into the inside pocket fishing out a piece of paper with the word Discount. A shop address was handwritten on it: Staighrem, Reaper Street, building 9, [#ffffff]Small Market[] District.",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.1.action.2": "The goblin jumps from the bench, gestures you to follow him and walks towards the exit. As you leave the bar, a strong hand grabs you by the collar and takes you away. Finding yourself in the nearby alley, you see the goblin again but now accompanied by a huge troll who puts his hand around your neck. Trying to escape, you provoke the thug to squeeze his hand even tighter. Everything goes dark and the noise in your ears drowns out all other sounds. After coming to yourself, you realize that the goblin robbed you.",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.2": "Opt out",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.2.action.1": "After checking you up and down, Goblin folds his tiny hands on the chest and spits on the floor. He is very dissatisfied with your decision to decline his services.",
  "goblin.in.a.bar.choice.2.action.2": "The green-skinned creature stares at you for half a minute. He clenches his teeth and tapping his fingers on the table. Then he slowly slops from the bench and says one short phrase, “You will regret it.” It seems that he did not like your tone.",
  "goblins.shop.text": "Wandering around the district, you accidentally run into the dirty shop sign that the goblin from the bar was talking about. A bulky man with huge circles around the eyes stands behind the counter. His tanned bald head shines in the light of an oil lamp and his impressive belly sways in rhythm with his movements. Seeing a card in your hands, he smiles and tells you about the terms. It turns out that the discount is valid for a random object and you can’t know what you are buying. The price of the current lot is [#ffffff]100 coins[].",
  "goblins.shop.choice.1": "Agree",
  "goblins.shop.choice.1.action.1": "The fat guy takes a notebook from under the counter. He makes a few notes, places an order, and puts a wooden box wrapped in manila paper and tied with a hemp rope on the table. You collect your purchase and leave the shop. After crossing the street, you sit down on the bench and open the box. Inside there are metal parts of unknown origin and many bolts of all possible sizes. Whatever it is, it’s unlikely can work.",
  "goblins.shop.choice.1.action.2": "The merchant completes the purchase by recording the amount of profit in the accounting papers and gives the wooden box to you. After going out on the street, you open the box and look at its contents. These are [#ffffff]treasures search glasses[]. And it costs twice cheaper than in other stores! Great buy!",
  "goblins.shop.choice.2": "Opt out",
  "goblins.shop.choice.2.action.1": "The shop owner looks at you unfriendly, takes your card and gestures toward the exit. Without waiting for you to leave, the fat man turns his back to you and starts stuffing the pipe with tobacco as if he had forgotten about your existence. You won’t have a second chance at a deal.",
  "goblins.shop.choice.2.action.2": "The fat man very nimbly for his size grabs a card from your hands. He looks at you for a second and then turns all his attention to something behind your back. You turn around and see nothing but suddenly feel a sharp pain at lower back and find yourself on the street. The door slammed shut and bolted behind you. It seems like you were thrown out with a kick in the back.",
  "goblins.revenge.text": "While exploring the city, you appeared on the deserted promenade with no lanterns. The fog covers water surface obscuring the debris floating in the yellow liquid. It's making the view almost beautiful. Watching the water surface, you notice some movement on your left. Your eyes suddenly start tingling. A cloud of strange dust veils you and clogs the lungs, preventing you from breathing.  Before the eyesight almost leaves you, you notice a familiar silhouette that utters one phrase before going away, “I told you, that you would regret it.” All you see is two muddy spots.",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.1": "Go in the direction of the blue spot",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.1.action.1": "You decide to move in the direction of the blue spot and suddenly lose balance, falling forward. At first, the blow makes you exhale air from the lungs, and then water covers you filling them. You manage to determine where the water surface is and swim out while coughing the dirty liquid. Gasping for air, you recover and throw yourself at the pier. Whatever was sprayed in your face, it was washed away by the water.",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.1.action.2": "You’re moving toward something blue, rising your hand ahead of you and trying to see something. Suddenly a blue spot comes to life and it seems like it is headed in your direction, becoming a little more oval and elongated in shape. Sharp pain pierces your wrist, which was pulled behind your back. A punch to the back of your head makes the world spin quicker. You wake up in a cell, wet with sweat, but alive and healthy. Apparently, you were given a sobering brew and the poison came out through the skin with other fluids.",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.2": "Go in the direction of the red spot",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.2.action.1": "You slowly wander toward the red spot, which becomes larger with each step. Your arm in front of you searches the space ahead trying to avoid the collision. Suddenly you feel searing, unbearable pain as if your fingers touches hot coals. Giving a heart-rending cry, you losing consciousness, and wake up only in the hospital. It seems like you were given an antidote injection and the payment was taken out of your possessions. Or maybe two payments.",
  "goblins.revenge.choice.2.action.2": "Barely moving your feet, you wander toward the blurred red spot, the only thing you can see with your swollen eyes. You trip and fall forward, but tiny yet strong hands pick you up as you are drifting into the darkness. You open your eyes and find yourself under the canopy of the residential wagon filled with bottles. The elderly female goblin bends over you, smiling from ear to ear with her gap-toothed mouth. This old lady has saved you from certain death.",
  "scientist.friend.text": "Passing by the workshop of your old friend Albert you decide to visit him and find out how he is doing. He is narrowly known as a mechanic and physicist-experimentalist.  To your surprise, you discover that he has achieved incredible progress in building his dream machine. It's a universal device for improving human physiology. According to Albert, right now he is ready to test it on humans, especially after the recent success in creating a runner pig. The machine can still be improved, though.",
  "scientist.friend.choice.1": "Offer yourself as a test subject",
  "scientist.friend.choice.1.action.1": "Clasping his hands, Albert offers to enter the wired cage standing behind him. Cone-shaped metal objects hang from the ceiling pointing at the centre: the place where you are standing ready for the tests. The scientist scratches his head, toggles a couple of switches and pulls the lever. A strange blue haze surrounds you, everything dissolves and... You find yourself in the middle of [#ffffff]Fairwell[] District square. Apparently, the device is not working as it should.",
  "scientist.friend.choice.1.action.2": "Albert helps you get into the wired cage. The control panel with lots of levers, switches, and buttons is located nearby. He looks at them for some time and then turns two round objects as if tuning some instrument. You are informed of the failure by the sound resembling a cry of a dying swan. All a sudden, the back panel of the remote control starts sparkling and explodes. A small piece of metal pierces your thigh.",
  "scientist.friend.choice.1.action.3": "You get up in the middle of the wired metal cage. Albert starts preparing while standing by the complex remote control. Nothing is happening for a few seconds, and then you feel a strange vibration in your body. Your muscles start heating up. You feel each of them separately; you feel your stomach work, your heartbeat, and electrical discharges in your brain. Emotions overwhelm you, but suddenly everything ends. Whatever it was, you feel wonderful.",
  "scientist.friend.choice.2": "Offer your assistance in bringing the machine to a perfect state",
  "scientist.friend.choice.2.action.1": "Albert is thinking for a second, and then he looks at you with a stunned and crazed look of a madman. It turns out that the mechanism of the machine has one detail, which has long worn out and needs replacing. It is something like an energy relay unit. The scientist has been dreaming to receive its new sample for several months now. He writes down the address on a piece of paper and hastily forces you out the door. You should visit the [#ffffff]Large Market[] District.",
  "scientist.friend.choice.3": "Refuse to participate in the experiment",
  "scientist.friend.choice.3.action.1": "Probably, this decision is right. Friendship is one thing, but you do not want to be blown sky-high as it was in the case with Albert’s steam-propelled car. If you think about it, he said then that tests had been successful. However, you still had to scrub away Baron von Lickershtadt, who was ordering the car, from the pavement.",
  "retranslator.getting.text": "After arriving at the address on Albert’s note, you see the pretentious shop. The shelves are packed with all kinds of mechanisms and devices, the purpose of which is a mystery to you. A friendly elderly elf in tiny glasses carefully looks around you and asks your permission to consult you. It turns out there're only one copy of the detail you need is left and will cost you as much as [#ffffff]20 coins[].",
  "retranslator.getting.choice.1": "Take a deal",
  "retranslator.getting.choice.1.action.1": "You decide to spare no expense for the benefit of science. You give the bag of cash to the seller. He quickly counts the money, giving two excess coins back to you, writes a receipt and gives you a box with an impressive mechanism. The polished brass on it dazzles with newness. Without a doubt, Albert will be delighted by this thing.",
  "retranslator.getting.choice.2": "Decline the purchase",
  "retranslator.getting.choice.2.action.1": "It’s nice to help science, but why would you waste so much money on dubious experiments? No way, let this madman look for another sponsor or another insane patron who is willing to spend a fortune on some part!",
  "retranslator.experiment.text": "As soon as you entered the laboratory, Albert grabbed the box with trembling hands, took a detail out of it and placed on the table. For a full minute, he was slowly shaking his head, examining it from all sides, as if trying to find some flaw or see a trick. After the examination, he turned around, looked at you and suddenly hugged you, tightly clutching you to his chest. It seems it was the highest gratitude this eccentric scientist is capable of. Everything is ready for the experiment!",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.1": "Offer yourself as a candidate for the experiment",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.1.action.1": "You decide to help your friend, offering yourself for a dangerous but potentially incredible experiment. It seems your dedication impressed Albert. He gladly accompanies you to the centre of the makeshift cell, to which he has connected a device that you brought. He flicks the switch, and you suddenly feel an incredible sense of excitement, and your body acquires fantastic tonus! It seems everything went well!",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.1.action.2": "You decide to help your friend, offering yourself for a dangerous but potentially incredible experiment. It seems your dedication impressed Albert. He gladly accompanies you to the centre of the makeshift cell, to which he has connected a device that you brought. He flicks the switch, and nothing happens. The machine is not working even with a new relay!",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.2": "Silently watch what is happening",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.2.action.1": "You closely watch Albert, who is scratching the back of his head, moving from the records to devices and back. He is mumbling something without noticing your presence and then suddenly claps his hands as if he had an epiphany. He pulls a small lever, clicks the tumbler, and then steps into something that resembles a cage. For a moment, the bluish glow surrounded him and then he disappears without a trace. What the hell just happened?!",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.3": "Leave",
  "retranslator.experiment.choice.3.action.1": "Well, your role in all this is accomplished and you can go back to your business. After a final look at dishevelled Albert, whose attention is fully absorbed by the devices and mechanisms, you go out and start walking along the waterfront.",
  "lost.scientist.text": "Passing by the leather-crafters shop, you suddenly notice your old friend Albert standing in the middle of the moving crowd. He looks completely disoriented and confused. It seems like he doesn't understand what is happening around him and how he ended up here. Apparently, this is the result of his experiment. You approach your friend and set your hand on his shoulder. It seems that he does not recognize you and looks at you questioningly and with suspicion.",
  "lost.scientist.choice.1": "Try to talk to Albert",
  "lost.scientist.choice.1.action.1": "You try to speak with your friend, but it seems he doesn't hear you, eyeing everything around him with his mouth open as if he sees the world for the first time. The more you try to communicate with him, the better you realize that he seems not to understand your words. All your attempts to make contact with him are fruitless. You set him on a bench and call an officer who is passing by, asking him to take Albert to the nearest hospital. Perhaps, someone can help him there.",
  "lost.scientist.choice.1.action.2": "You start to slowly and clearly ask Albert questions. At first, he does not react, but the more you talk, the stronger his emotional response is. A few minutes later, Albert suddenly jumps up, looks around and asks you just one question, “Did I really fail?!” He seems to be all right.",
  "lost.scientist.choice.2": "Take him home",
  "lost.scientist.choice.2.action.1": "You’re trying to take Albert back to his laboratory, but he adamantly refuses to go with you. You even have to drag him, but the genius trails behind you and suddenly starts screaming trying to get free and bite your wrist. The nearest police patrol heads in your direction requesting an explanation of what is going on. After hearing your story, they decide to deliver Albert home on their own. You can only hope that he will be all right.",
  "lost.scientist.choice.2.action.2": "At first, Albert follows you half-heartedly, but the closer you are to his laboratory the more confident his pace becomes. A shadow of recognition appears on his face. Once you cross the threshold of his home, he suddenly turns around and seems to have recognized you. Without saying a word, he rushes to his machine and starts checking his records in the computing log. He seems all right now.",
  "lost.scientist.choice.3": "Slap Albert on the face",
  "lost.scientist.choice.3.action.1": "You slap Albert on the face with all your might. Passers-by are staring at you, but you are still holding the scientist by the collar waiting for his reaction. Dumbfounded inventor looks around, then looks you in the eye. He turns his gaze to your palm that ready to slap him once more. “Don’t you dare hit the scholar on the head, you brute! Unlike you, I still need it!” Albert breaks free, adjusts his clothes and adds, “But thanks for your care, my friend.”",
  "lost.scientist.choice.4": "Leave him alone",
  "lost.scientist.choice.4.action.1": "You decide to leave Albert alone and let him come to his senses. Eventually, sanity will return to him, and he might even think about introducing some safety rules for such cases. Just think, he accidentally invents a device that moves a person through space! Nonsense!",

The capital is characterised by racial diversity. The majority of elves, who created the Empire and founded Staighrem after the cataclysm, belong to the nobility. But it becomes more often that you can meet them among factory workers or at trading stalls because of the impoverishment of many previously great clans. Humans are the most numerous race in Staighrem and throughout the Empire, though it was destroyed by the cataclysm several thousand years ago. For more than a century, people have been taking an active part in the political life of the Empire and today occupy half of the seats in the Emperor’s Council. Goblins and trolls are two more races that can be found in Staighrem. The former ones are innate dealers and scammers. They are mostly engaged in a trade or steal from the gaping passers-by. The latter ones are a combination of enormous muscular strength and low intelligence. So, they do the most physically challenging work at Staighrem factories and plants and are the major fighting force of the city underworld. You, the inventor Wilson Smith, has had to deal with the above-mentioned criminal world face-to-face. After bizarre events that caused the death of your friend and nearly killed you, almost all cutthroats of the capital started hunting you. Deciding to visit your workshop in the basement of one of Bridgewall District residential houses after the attack in your apartment, you find it completely battered. You take the parts that were left untouched and a device chart you have been working on recently and decide to start searching for Alexander Cooper immediately without lingering anywhere. First, you need to visit the address on the envelope, which Arthur gave you before his death: 17 Whisper Street, {{var}}. You use a self-propelled electric machine, which you assembled by yourself to move around Staighrem. It can drive through one city district on a single battery charge and then needs recharging, which unfortunately costs money. Yet, you can always make some money in industrial districts of the city. It is time to go now.",
  "search.1": "You go to the address on the envelop and find a dilapidated two-storey building. You decide to go inside through the damaged front door and find yourself in the room, which apparently has not been used for many years. The entire floor and rare furniture that is falling apart are covered in a thick layer of dust. You go around all rooms that were still accessible though find nothing but the old card of “Green Hare” establishment at 52 Zimmer Street, {{var}}. Perhaps, someone there can tell you where to find Alexander Cooper.",
  "search.2": "There was no “Green Hare” establishment at the specified address. A nursery was located in its place. Its owner told you that before this shelter for unfortunate animals was open, “Green Hare” tavern really had been here. Taverns owner, Mr McGuffey, had to close the establishment because it was unprofitable. But he still has another tavern in Staighrem with the same name in one of {{var}} districts.",
  "search.3": "You managed to find the “Green Hare” tavern. To your joy, Warren McGuffey, its owner, told you that he really had known a person named Alexander Cooper. But, your joy was short-lived. According to Mr McGuffey, Alexander died many years ago. The “Green Hare” owner advised you to visit {{var}}, where the city archive is located. Perhaps, there you will find information about Cooper’s relatives to find them and give Arthur’s letter.",
  "search.3.start": "It turns out you have to pay to enter the city archive. To get inside, you have to pay {{var}} {{var}}.",
  "search.3.variant.accept": "Pay and go inside",
  "search.3.variant.cancel": "Do not visit the archive",
  "search.4": "After visiting the city archive, you managed to find out that Alexander Cooper was a well-known inventor. It is even strange that you have never heard of him. He has no living relatives, and the house, where he lived, was demolished over a year ago. The only clue is Cooper’s workshop. You decide to go to {{var}}, where it was located. Perhaps, you will find someone who might help you decipher Arthur’s letter. As you exit the archive and walk a few blocks, you notice that a man in the long coat with his collar raised and his cap pulled over his eyes is following you. To escape the pursuit, you unexpectedly turn into the nearest backstreet and quickly run dodging between the houses. The manoeuvre was successful, and the pursuer is no longer seen.",
  "search.5": "Alexander Cooper’s workshop turned out to be almost as abandoned as the building on Whisper Street. You easily managed to get inside and explore the workshop premises. In one of the desk drawers, you find a photo of Cooper (you have already seen his portrait among archive materials) and Sir Frederick Linton: Staighrem industrial tycoon, who owns all the city factories. You decide to go to {{var}}, where Linton’s mansion is located. Most likely, he was on good terms with Cooper and can help you with Arthur’s cryptogram. Suddenly you heard rustling behind your back, you turn around but see no one there and decide to leave this place.",
  "search.6": "You were approaching Linton’s mansion when someone grabbed you from behind and closing your mouth with the hand dragged you in the thick decorative bushes. “Mr Smith, coming to Frederick Linton was the silliest thing you could think of,” someone’s voice right at your ear said. Your kidnapper loosened his grip, and you could turn around to see him. It was the same man in the coat who ran after you after visiting the archive. “The person you are looking for is alive and wants to meet you, Mr Smith. I will give you the address. And stay away from Linton! It can end up tragically for you,” the kidnapper gave you a sheet of paper and disappeared. All this was very strange, but you decided to trust this man. Looking at the note, you saw the address, written so unintelligibly that you could only read “building 64 by the Freedom pillar.” There are only several of such pillars in Staighrem, and all of them are located in {{var}} districts.",
  "search.7": "You have found the right building near the pillar and knocked on the only door. It opened immediately, and someone’s hand grabbed you and dragged you inside. “Welcome to the Order of Secret Guardians! My name is Jimmy, you already know Wilford,” a robust fellow in the factory uniform told you. You notice the same guy in the coat and cap standing against the wall, whose name apparently is Wilford. “It took you long to get here, Mister Smith!” he says to you, and then informs you that Alexander Cooper had to leave without waiting for you. Wilford gave you the address where Cooper would be waiting for you to answer all your questions: {{var}}, 79 Palmer Street.",
  "search.8": "At the address given by Wilford, you find an old five-storey building. Going inside, you hear a voice coming out of nowhere. He tells you how to find the elevator and go underground. Downstairs, a man with his face covered with a mask was waiting for you. The tubes connected it to a small device attached to the man’s body. As it turned out, it was Alexander Cooper himself. To your surprise, he knew that you were hunted after your friend Arthur’s death. Without waiting for your questions, Cooper decided to clarify the situation. Over ten years ago, he was also an inventor and had been working for the benefit of the city. Together with Frederick Linton, he managed to implement a project of Staighrem electrification. Their views on granting access to electricity for regular city residents were drastically different. Cooper wanted to create a super cheap system of generators that could enable everyone to use electricity for free. Linton could only think about huge profits. Their confrontation ended with the assassination attempt on Alexander’s life. Linton’s mercenaries started a fire in Cooper’s apartment closing him inside. By a miracle, Alexander managed to get out, but the face and respiratory tract burns left no chance for salvation. Cooper’s friend, professor Berstein, saved him. He made a mask and a special device that helps Alexander breathe even now. After this event, Cooper organized the Order of Secret Guardians to counteract Linton, whose goals were becoming increasingly self-serving and the methods more and more illegal. Your friend Arthur was one of the Order agents. He was uncovered and killed, and you were chased. After hearing Alexander’s story, you told about the cryptogram Arthur had given you before his death. Looking at the note, Cooper says with regret that he can not decipher it here, as the decryption device is located in the other headquarters of the Order in {{var}}. Alexander offers to go separately, so as not to attract attention.",
  "search.9": "You find Alexander Cooper in the Order headquarters and judging by his abrupt movements you understand that he is disturbed by something. Without any greetings, Alexander started decrypting the cryptogram. It turns out, Arthur managed to collect data proving that Frederick Linton had created a substance capable of neutralising elves’ magical powers. He planned to spray it over Staighrem. It sounded very strange to you. After all, it has always been considered that the Emperor was the only Elf able to use magic. He draws all his magic from the Ancient Stone, some sort of mysterious artefact. It seems, Alexander did not notice your confusion and continued. Considering, how late the letter arrived at him, Linton must have already implemented his plan. Now you need to act very fast. Alexander asked for your help in fighting Linton. Upon receiving your consent, he sent you to Wilford to {{var}}, who would explain everything on site. Giving you a note with the exact address, he vanished immediately. What does Linton have to do with elves? What kind of magical power is it? You can only hope that Wilford has answers to all your questions.",
  "search.10": "Wilford was waiting for you at the specified address. He informed you that he needed your help in creating an antidote, which would return magical powers to elves in the city. You decide to ask what kind of magical power it was. Wilford briefly filled you in on elvish race. Since birth, all its representatives own magical power and know how to use it. The cataclysm caused by humans several thousand years ago had such terrible consequences that elves could not restore the planet even with the help of their magic. So the Ancient Stone was created. It collects magical powers of each elf and increases it thanks to the synergy effect. It is only with the help of this artefact that the elder brothers of humanity managed to create an oasis on the blasted lands, which is now called the Empire. Only the Emperor is allowed to use the power of the Ancient Stone, whereas ordinary elves lost the ability to use magic. This artefact is almost impossible to destroy. At least Frederick Linton had never learned how to do it. But, he found a way to significantly weaken it. Having neutralised the magic power of Staighrem elves, which the Ancient Stone collects, Linton made it completely useless. This will enable him to seize power in the Empire with little efforts. Arthur’s letter says about neutralisation, which means that there is a great chance that you can create an antidote. But, to do that you need to find a formula of the substance, which Linton sprays over the city. Fortunately, Wilford turned out to be an excellent lock picker and had even developed a plan. It is possible to get into Frederick Linton’s lab through one of the abandoned stations of the old subway. After sending you to {{var}}, where the entrance to the station is located, Wilford went to collect necessary tools.",
  "search.11": "After meeting Wilford at the entrance to the abandoned subway station, you waited till the dusk and descended underground. On your way to the destination, you decide to find out more about Frederick Linton. Judging from the information available to the Order, he had been planning to unleash a war with the Emperor and the Council for a long time now. In his opinion, only people deserve to be the rulers of the Earth, while elves usurped power. There are suspicions that Linton secretly and contrary to the prohibition, makes weapons of mass destruction. But, the Order has no direct proof. So, Linton is still not punished. If it is true, then nothing can stop Frederick Linton without the power of the Ancient Stone. Chaos and war will swallow the Empire. When you reach your destination, Wilford uses subtle devices to make a hole in the ceiling through which you can get into the lab. There is no one here, and all the security systems are focused on entrances and exits. After searching several rooms, you have managed to get the formula of the substance, which Linton used to neutralise the magical powers of elves. When you got out, Wilford sent you to {{var}} to the best chemist of the Order, Professor Berstein, who once saved Alexander Cooper’s life. The scientist will start creating an antidote as soon as he receives the formula.",
  "search.12": "You easily found professor Berstein’s laboratory and gave him the formula. He really proved to be a genius chemist. The antidote was ready in a couple of hours. During that time, you managed to ask the professor about Alexander Cooper. Although they have known each other for a couple of decades, Berstein could not tell much about the leader of the Order of Secret Guardians, “He always was very secretive. I was amazed by his resemblance to Frederick Linton. They are like two sides of the same coin. They both own knowledge inaccessible to the regular human, but they are using this knowledge completely differently.” After creating the antidote, the main problem was to somehow spray it over the city. You decide to undertake this mission and sketch a chart of the device that can help pulverise the antidote so that a resulting cloud would cover all Staighrem. You will need {{var}}, {{var}} and {{var}}, as well as some tools that are difficult to find in ordinary workshops. Fortunately, Berstein gave you the address of the Order workshop, where you can find everything you might need to construct the pulveriser. You need to collect all the parts and immediately go to the {{var}} to start working.",

  "search.13": "You assembled the pulveriser for the antidote in the workshop. Now you need to find the right spot high above the city to launch the device and do not forget to account for the direction and intensity of the wind. You remembered about your friend Willie who owns a hot-air balloon and raises city residents and tourists in the sky for money. You decide to ask your friend for help. But to do so, you need to find him first. He usually works in one of Staighrem {{var}} districts.",
  "search.14": "You see Willie near the hot-air balloon tied to the ground on the largest square of the district. You describe the terrible situation in the city to him and ask for help. Your friend agreed immediately. Based on weather forecasts, Willie had calculated the best lifting point and sent you to {{var}}. If you go up in the air from the centre of this district, the wind will help you spread the cloud of antidote in the right direction.",
  "search.fail.2": "Your search yielded no results. Residents of the district have never heard of the “Green Hare” tavern or its owner, McGuffey. We need to continue looking in another district.",

  "outro.0": "Willie’s hot-air balloon was moving upwards quickly, and twenty minutes later it was on the desired height above the city. You started your device and, if Willie’s calculations were correct, then the antidote cloud would cover the city in a few minutes. All you need to do is to wait and hope that you managed to get ahead of Linton. You and Willie were peacefully discussing his amazing balloon when suddenly you heard the loud voice, which was probably sounding even in the most remote corner of Staighrem, “You are late, Cooper! I know that you survived ten years ago. But today I will get the job done!” The voice was coming from loudspeakers installed on the airship hovering over the city centre. News and advertisements were usually broadcasted from this airship.",
  "outro.1": "Most likely, the person speaking was in the airship car and because it was soundproof was not aware that the whole city was hearing him. “You will not be able to fulfil your plans neither today nor ever again!” it was a familiar voice distorted by the respiratory mask now. You looked down and noticed that the streets were filling with citizens attracted by the strange dialogue. It was wonderful for you since that way the antidote would work faster. “One day the mankind will definitely rise, but it won’t be a result of war as you wish, it will happen thanks to peaceful actions!”",
  "outro.2": "Alexander was interrupted by harsh laughter, “I don’t want mankind to rise, I want its regeneration as it happened to me thousands of years ago. The power that had caused the cataclysm gave me eternal life, and today this power will break free again. Many will die, but this is a modest price for the chosen to enter a new stage of evolution. The mechanism is running. Neither you nor the Emperor with his stone is able to stop it.” A moment later, a giant glowing cloud appeared in the middle of the city. A monstrous force has sent the balloon and the airship flying in different directions. Miraculously, you managed to stay inside the basket. You raised eyes and saw an amazing view. The cloud wrapped by luminous green threads was rising to the sky in the form of a column. It became thinner with every second until it disappeared completely.",
  "outro.3": "Alexander’s voice sounded in the silence looming over the city, “The Ancient Stone regained its force. Frederick, these thousands of years have driven you crazy. Eternal life is not a gift: it is a curse. And you are not the only one whom this curse has come upon. You and I, we are not getting older, but we are still mortal. I figured it out ten years ago when I was trying to get out of a fire. You wanted to finish what we had started, and I will help you with this. But you will leave with me. We do not belong to this era, and we never did,” his voice was drowned in the thunder of explosions. Hydrogen inside the airship flamed up instantly. In a moment it was consumed by fire. Quickly losing altitude, the burning airship carried Frederick Linton and Alexander Cooper to the ground."
